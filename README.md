# Breast-Cancer

Code for analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data to assess the impact of age, parity, and BRCA1 loss-of-function mutations on breast cancer risk.


milo --> investigating changes in cell type composition

dge --> differential gene expression

immune --> Investigate changes in immune checkpoint expression associated with age, parity, and BRCA1 loss-of-function mutations

get_nmf --> Use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to investigate changes in gene expression patterns.

select_k --> Method used to determine the optimal number of components (k) for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
